# Free AI Question Generation Setup

## 🆓 Free AI Options

We now support **Google Gemini** which offers a **completely free tier** with no credit card required!

### Option 1: Google Gemini (Recommended - FREE)

**Advantages:**
- ✅ Completely free (no credit card needed)
- ✅ Generous free tier (60 requests per minute)
- ✅ Good quality question generation
- ✅ Easy to set up

**Setup Steps:**

1. **Get Free API Key:**
   - Go to: https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey
   - Sign in with your Google account
   - Click "Create API Key"
   - Copy your API key

2. **Add to .env file:**
   ```bash
   # In backend/.env
   GEMINI_API_KEY=your-gemini-api-key-here
   ```

3. **Install package (already done):**
   ```bash
   pip install google-generativeai
   ```

4. **That's it!** The system will automatically use Gemini if the key is set.

### Option 2: OpenAI (Paid)

- Requires credits/billing
- Better quality but costs money
- Set `OPENAI_API_KEY` in `.env`

### How It Works

The system tries AI providers in this order:
1. **Groq** (if `GROQ_API_KEY` is set) – free tier available at https://console.groq.com
2. **Gemini** (if `GEMINI_API_KEY` is set) – FREE
3. **OpenAI** (if `OPENAI_API_KEY` is set) – PAID
4. **Mock/Sample** questions (if none are available)

When you run the backend, the server console will print which provider was used, e.g.:
- `[EasyTest AI] Generated 5 questions using Groq for topic: ...`
- `[EasyTest AI] No API key configured. Using sample questions. Add GROQ_API_KEY or GEMINI_API_KEY to .env`

### Get Your Free Gemini API Key

1. Visit: https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey
2. Sign in with Google
3. Click "Create API Key"
4. Copy the key
5. Add to `backend/.env`:
   ```
   GEMINI_API_KEY=your-key-here
   ```

### Free Tier Limits

**Google Gemini:**
- 60 requests per minute
- 1,500 requests per day
- Completely free, no credit card needed

This is more than enough for generating questions!

### Testing

After adding your Gemini API key, restart your Django server and try generating questions. You should see real AI-generated questions instead of sample ones.

### Troubleshooting

**Error: "GEMINI_API_KEY not set"**
- Make sure you added the key to `.env` file
- Restart Django server after adding

**Error: "google-generativeai not installed"**
- Run: `pip install google-generativeai`

**Still getting sample questions?**
- Check Django logs for error messages
- Verify API key is correct
- Make sure you restarted the server
